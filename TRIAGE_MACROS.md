# Triage macros (copy/paste)

## No logs / need repro
Thanks — I can’t diagnose without a reproducible report.

Please re-run using release v0.1.0 and paste:
1) tag/version
2) exact command(s)
3) full stdout/stderr logs
4) OS + Python version

See pinned issue “Start here” for the minimal reproduce commands.

## Spec ambiguity
Thanks — please file this as “Spec ambiguity” and include:
- SPEC section (SPEC.md and/or telemetry_cts/SPEC/*)
- what is ambiguous (2+ plausible interpretations)
- proposed minimal normative wording
- a fixture/test vector that would pin determinism

Core stays minimal; extensions should be done via profiles.

## Security / vulnerability (public -> private)
Please do not share vulnerability details in a public issue.

Use GitHub Security → “Report a vulnerability” (preferred) or follow SECURITY.md (email fallback).
I will close this thread to avoid public disclosure of exploit details.
