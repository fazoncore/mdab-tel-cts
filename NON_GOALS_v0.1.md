# Non-goals (v0.1)

- This is NOT a formal standard and does not imply endorsement by any organization.
- This is NOT a security guarantee; it provides verifiable evidence formats + a CTS/verifier.
- It does NOT protect against a compromised host/OS, stolen signing keys, or insider event forgery.
- It does NOT define transport/storage guarantees, network protocols, or operational security controls.
- It does NOT define policy semantics or enforcement; it focuses on deterministic telemetry evidence and verification.
